# RoboCar 1/10 ROS nodes for deploying deep learning detection models #
***

## Dependencies ##
***

- [x86 Specific Dependencies](docs/dependencies_installation_x86.md) (not needed on robot)
- [Jetson Inference Library](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference):

## Jetson Inference Build ##
***
* Clone. 
    * If master branch does not work, it can be changed to branch for your jetpack version like this:
```shell
cd ~
git clone --recursive -b L4T-R34.1.1 https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference.git
```

* Then follow [**the instruction**](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/building-repo-2.md) for your version.

* During cmake step of installation, please, select model 15 and disable others, as on the following image:

## Usage ##
***

```
make deps         # check dependencies
make              # build
make run          # roslaunch (see below)
make show         # show overlay image in rviz
```

**RosLaunch**
```bash
roslaunch rc110_object_detection rc110_object_detection_node.launch

# or launch with rviz
roslaunch rc110_object_detection rc110_object_detection_node_rviz.launch
```

- The first time you launch the node, it will start the build of tensorrt's runtime engine, so it will take a little while ONLY for this first time.

## Subscribed Topics ##

## Parameters ##
***

```text
confidence_thresh (float, default: 0.6)
    threshold of confidence score of the detection network.
    confidence score is the probability that a bounding box contains an object.

model_path (string)
    absolute path to model weights

class_labels_path (string)
    absolute path to the labels file

overlay_str (string, default: box,labels,conf)
    contents that will be drawn on overlaid debug image

input_blob (string, default: Input)
    name of the input layer blob

output_blob (string, default: NMS)
    name of the output layer blob containing the bounding boxes

output_count (string, default: NMS_1)
    name of the output layer blob containing the detection count

mean_pixel (float, default: 0.0)
    mean pixel value used for (z-score) normalization of input image

std_pixel (float, default: 1.0)
    standard deviation pixel value used for (z-score) normalization of input image

use_darknet_yolo (bool, default: false)
    flag to specify if the current model is darknet yolo or not

num_channels (int, default: 3)
    number of channels of the network input

input_height (int, default: 300)
    height of the network input

input_width (int, default: 300)
    width of the network input
```

# Additional Info #
## Models Download ##
***

Models download can be started after build with a different command:

```bash
cd ~/jetson-inference/tools
./download-models.sh
```

* The models are saved in
    - `~/jetson-inference/data/networks/SSD-Inception-v2`
* There are two files in the directory:
    1. `ssd_coco_labels.txt` (label file)
    2. `ssd_inception_v2_coco.uff` (weights file)

## Train Your Own Models  ##
***

There are 3 ways to train your own models that can be inferred by this node.

- Use [this training tool](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/pytorch-collect-detection.md) prepared by jetson-inference.
This tool is a fork of [pytorch-ssd](https://github.com/qfgaohao/pytorch-ssd) and it supports training of light-weight mobilenet-based SSD.
These light-weight models are fast but can only provide slightly decent detection accuracy.
This is the easiest way to train a model compatible with jetson-inference.
For more explanation see: [pytorch_ssd.md](docs/pytorch_ssd.md)

- Use [darknet framework](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) to train your own yolo models and use [pytorch-YOLOv4](https://github.com/Tianxiaomo/pytorch-YOLOv4) to export to [onnx](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) format.
The jetson-inference library, by default, does not support yolo models. However, this node has already modified detectNet class to read model weights trained this way.

- Use [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). The procedure to train with this API and export tensorflow weights to weight formats compatible with jetson-inference is indeed complicated. Users might even need to customize their own detectNet class to support models trained this way.
