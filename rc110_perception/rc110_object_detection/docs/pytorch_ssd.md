Go to `jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd/data` and create an empty directory to store the dataset and a text file to define the class labels.

Stop robocar movement with:   
```
$ cd ros/src/robocar110_ros/ 
$ make stop
```

Open a new terminal and type the following command to start the camera.  
```
$ camera-capture /dev/video0   # using V4L2 camera /dev/video0
```

When Data Capture Control is opened, change Dataset Type to Detection, and link Dataset Path and Class label to the ones you created above.

Make sure that the object is within the frame of the camera, and press the Freeze/Edit button (or the space key) to freeze the image and draw a bounding box on the image.

Labeling the image by selecting the appropriate object class for each bounding box. After labeling is finished, click the Freeze/Edit button to save the data and release freeze for the next labeling.

Once you have enough data, create an empty directory in `jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd/models` (e.g. directory name: training) and move each image data and the text files defining the class labels. 

Please, check that you have `train_ssd.py` file in `jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd` directory. Do the following if not:  
```
$ git submodule update https://github.com/dusty-nv/pytorch-ssd
```

After installing the package, open a new terminal and type the following command to set up.  
```
$ cd jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd 
$ wget https://nvidia.box.com/shared/static/djf5w54rjvpqocsiztzaandq1m3avr7c.pth -O models/mobilenet-v1-ssd-mp-0_675.pth 
$ pip3 install -v -r requirements.txt
```

Then, open a new terminal and train the model using train_ssd.py.  
```
$ cd jetson-inference/python/training/detection/ssd 
$ python3 train_ssd.py --dataset-type=voc --data=data/<YOUR-DATASET> --model-dir=models/<YOUR-MODEL>
```

After training, the PyTorch model needs to be converted to Onnx data.  
```
$ python3 onnx_export.py --model-dir=models/<YOUR-MODEL>
```

The converted model will be saved as <YOUR-MODEL>/ssd-mobilenet.onnx and can be loaded by entering the following command.  
```
NET=models/<YOUR-MODEL>

detectnet --model=$NET/ssd-mobilenet.onnx --labels=$NET/labels.txt \ 
          --input-blob=input_0 --output-cvg=scores --output-bbox=boxes \  
            /dev/video0
```
