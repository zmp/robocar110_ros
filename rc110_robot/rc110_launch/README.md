### IMU ###
***

- Current IMU in robocar110 consists of a single-axis gyroscope and an accelerometer. We use [imu_complementary_filter](https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/imu_tools/tree/melodic/imu_complementary_filter) to integrate the two sensors to estimate orientation.

### Camera ###
***

- Please follow this [Camera Calibration](docs/CameraCalibration.md) to obtain calibration parameters. This calibration step is optional.
- The default path of calibration params for front camera is set in *camera_info_url* of [this configuration file](config/sensors/front_camera.yaml); and optionally, [here](config/sensors/rear_camera.yaml) for rear camera.

- ROS system will give a warning if the calibration files do not exist, which is an expected behavior and can be ignored.
