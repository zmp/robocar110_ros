# ROS Installation

If ROS is not installed, please, install it following the instruction:

http://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html

Alternatively you can use the following command, but we cannot guarantee it will always work.
```
cd ~/ros/src/robocar110_ros/  # repo root
make ros-install
```

### ROS Environment
Optionally, ros sourcing can be put to `~/.bashrc`. You need to restart terminal after that.
```
make ros-source
```
